# Election-analysis

## Project Overview
This project we are helping Tom, a Colorado board of elections employee, in an election audit of a congressional precinct. We were given a CSV file and using python were asked to find specific results for the precinct. The results we need to end with are the total number of votes, number if votes per candidate, percentage of votes each candidate received, and the winner based on the popular vote. This project we created code using loops, if-else statements, reading, and writing text files

## Resources
- Data source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual studio Code 1.52.1

## Election_Audit Results
Below are the results that we can confirm as the outcomes for this Colorado precinct:
